<p>You've probably heard it a dozen times before. You’re not sure if the time is right or if it’s the right direction to go. So you put it on the <strong>backburner</strong>, cause <em>you’ll get back to it later.</em> You've been told <em>it's easy!<sup>tm</sup></em> but that doesn't really help much.</p>
<p>In this post, I will be touching on various problems, and scenarios people face when wanting to start projects. This topic has come up various times throughout my entrepreneurial career.</p>
<h2>Disqualification Before an Attempt was Made.</h2>
<p>Disqualifying yourself from even starting your idea for fear of “it may not be the right fit” is a good way to hamper what could be your next great project. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t think and plan it out before hand. However, planning and thought can be used as a crutch to make yourself feel productive, and should be done to the extent where you can foresee a path worth taking (i.e. the vision). People tend to get caught up and spend more time planning and less time executing. Don’t feel bad about wasted time, cause in the grand scheme of things, wasted time isn’t really wasted if you learned things along the way.</p>
<h2>Leverage Existing Technologies and Do Things That Don’t Scale</h2>
<p>This could be an entire post in itself, but it’s definitely worth mentioning. Some individuals are very against the idea of leveraging pre-existing technologies/tools because they feel they can do a better job. If you put yourself in this group of individuals, I encourage you to read on. You are probably right. You can do better than those existing technologies/tools, but you should ask yourself is this a productive use of time? Will spending X hours of your limited time be worth creating Y? Can you honestly… really… justify it? Take a moment and really think about this. The answer you should arrive at in regards to those questions should be <strong>no</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your Next Best Thing is an app that directly posts camera photos and uses facial recognition to tag the appropriate people on Twitter, and you decide to spend several hours on creating your own Twitter API wrapper that time could likely be spent somewhere else more productively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which brings us to the second part of this section. <strong>Do things that</strong> <strong>don’t scale</strong>. At my current employer, the CEO has taken it upon himself to assist in the hiring process by directly contacting people through various network channels. Doing this at scale wouldn’t be ideal and a good use of his limited time, but surprisingly you can get away with this for a long time. A really huge bonus with approaching tasks with in a non-scalable way, is you are able to be more personable and it gives you insight that you may never have with a more <em>optimized</em> solution.</p>
<p>Some individuals may argue that automation is the answer in most cases. I would argue that pre-automation is in the same basket as pre-optimization. You don’t need it, until it becomes a problem.</p>

<h2>What if?</h2>
<p>A really common thread I’ve found from talking to people about ideas, they all seem to mention the classic “What if?”. Let me set the scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re on the way home from work and you let your mind wander. Eventually an problem/idea/solution emerges.</p>
<p>You start to think about all the possibilities and how to approach this going forward.</p>
<p>You mention the idea to a colleague/partner/friend and you’re immediately bombarded with “What if?”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From your colleague/partner/friend’s position it may feel like they’re helping you! Unfortunately, that is not the case. Now, don’t get upset they don’t know any better. In fact, most people don’t. A great quote from someone I’m sure you know of really suits this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”
— Henry Ford</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure it would be fair to suggest a majority of people can’t visualize what could be, and wont realize what the vision is until it is in front of their face. My best advice is to find people with goals, and ignore the ones without. You don’t need their feedback… yet. The people you need to find do not necessarily have to be in the same niche or business, but people that will approach your ideas with an open mind. Instead of immediately being shutdown with the “What if’s”, they can help you focus and refine the idea down further, possibly suggesting further routes you can take if you decide to go forward.</p>
<p>I’m confident that if you asked any of the great entrepreneurs in the world about the “What If’s” of their idea at the time, most would say the thought never entered their mind.</p>
<p>“What If’s” can be tackled when you get there, there is no reason to worry about what hasn’t happened. <strong>You don’t know if it will ever happen.</strong></p>
<h2>Give Yourself <em>roughly</em> an Hour Each Day</h2>
<p>Just ease yourself into it, like anything in life. It takes time. Time is the most valuable thing you have, and you can start to better utilize it by taking it 1 hour at a time. The reason why I used <em>roughly</em> is to give you some room to fit it into your lifestyle. Life is complicated. However, you must ask yourself, what can I do right now that will set me up for the following day, while dedicating the least amount of time I can afford right now.</p>
<p>Originally, I took a hard stance on doing at least an hour a day, but I realized that the hour rule doesn’t apply to everything. A great example of this could be as simple as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will take a minimum of 1 photo and post it on Instagram everyday for a month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading that simple goal, you could likely agree that it is <em>very</em> reasonable and achievable within the time-frame. Whether or not you take a <em>good</em> photo or bad one is totally your call, but we can probably agree that at least 1 hour dedicated to this activity would be ideal. Over time you can eventually transform that goal into something more ambitious, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will take a minimum of 3 photo’s, and post them on Instagram at different times everyday for the next 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not familiar with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable/Actionable, Relevant, Time Based/Bound), it is a way of structuring your goals in order to make them easier to achieve and more focused. Let’s destruct the previous quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will take a minimum of 3 photo’s, and post them on Instagram at different times everyday for the next 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>specific</strong>. It clearly outlines what the objective is, and when it needs to be done.</li>
<li>It is <strong>measured</strong> by how much content was product at the end of the day.</li>
<li>The amount and action is where the real meat of this lies. It is better to make the goal too easy than for it to be too hard, and deter yourself from doing it. So make sure it’s <strong>attainable</strong>!</li>
<li>If your goal is to be more active on Instagram or to get better at Photography, than this would be <strong>relevant</strong> to what you want to achieve.</li>
<li>It is <strong>time-bound</strong>, which specifically gives you an end to this goal. In this example, it has to be done everyday for 3 months. At the end of 3 months, you should reevaluate what you’ve accomplished, and see what you can do better.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rapidly Prototype</h2>
<p>I know that this post is getting to be a bit long, but I promise this will be short. Learn how to execute your ideas/solutions as fast as possible. Over time, you will get better at this, and will be able to test many ideas and processes as fast as they come. Being able to eliminate the things that do and don’t work as fast as possible, will save you an abundance of time. Avoid the “fluff” and just focus on rapidly iterating over your idea until you’ve molded it into something that feels right.</p></main></article></div></div></body></html>
