<p><strong>Pivot's are a good thing.</strong> When things just aren't working, it's okay to pivot your business model.
During the development &#x26; release of VanCity Drinks app, we pivoted a few times. Initially we had decided
that we were going to be Vancouver's go-to source for happy hour special information, with the Mood Board as an added extra.
We put a lot of attention toward filtering types of happy hours. The second iteration of the app, we came to the realization
that users cared more about the actual bar they were presently at. Our response to this was to replace the happy hour special
filters with a venue search. We caught a little flak for this, but we stuck to our guns and rode it out. It made more sense,
from an analytics and experience point of view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>I should mention, bars have happy hour specials on their respective page.
<em>I digress...</small></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after releasing the venue search update, we started collecting feedback. This was the moment we realized, people didn't care as much
about finding <em>the best</em> deals, but rather <em>the best places</em>. With more of a focus on curation and creating more vibes, we realized that
VanCity Drinks app would be the answer to the classic question: <em>"Where do you wanna go tonight?"</em>. With a list of the top 10 bars in the
Vancouver area, users were given options. It's a lot easier to choose from a list of <em>curated</em> options, than doing a search online or thinking of one.
So what did we pivot to? We pivoted from providing a service, to an experience. The best deals, while considerably valuable, just didn't fill the keg<small>(zing)</small>.
The curation of restaurants in a city that is known for it's beauty, is huge for not just visitors but newcomers and locals.</p>
<p><strong>Proof is in the pudding.</strong> Knowing when to take a step back and re-evaluate, is incredibly powerful.
While we had seen very good MAU (Monthly Active User) trends, we knew that we couldn't keep up with how often bars update their data and the demand that it took to do it.
Everyone on VanCity Drinks was helping <strong><em>voluntarily</em></strong>, with the incentives of commission on paid advertisement, and drinks/meals for events. This obviously wouldn't scale,
we were 100% bootstrapped. We had spent months thinking of ways we could approach this hurdle, and after many unsuccessful attempts, it brings us to where I got that call.</p>
<p>Some approaches &#x26; ideas we had <small>cant <small>remember <small>them <small>all :c</small></small></small></small>:</p>
<p>One approach was to slice the map of Vancouver into sections. With designated bars for people to hit in that section. They were "responsible" for that section.
This didn't work too great based on the location of the team and bars, we had too many people some sections and too few in others. Paired with the reluctance to go to more
out of the way bars.</p>
<p>Another idea we had was to create individual web-crawlers for bars. However, at the time we felt the amount of effort required (being that there were only 2 programmers) didn't
outweight the benefits of having to maintain them, that's if bars even have them listed...</p>
<p>Now you must be asking yourself, why didn't you just ask the bars to help? We did. But that is for the third, and final part... <em>BOOM! <strong>mic drop</strong></em></p></main></article></div></div></body></html>
