While the journey isn\'t over, I am extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to create and manage a project with such ambitious goals and driven partners, constantly pushing one another to be their best.</p>\n<p>Shortly after receiving the text, I went to grab a coffee and hit <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/benmcrae87/">@benmcrae87</a></strong> back. After exchanging greetings, he cut to the chase. What came out was something we all knew deep down, but didn\'t want to say out loud.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>"...Take down the app."</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first, caught off-guard with what I had just heard. After what was only a few seconds, but felt like minutes I had already agreed. We knew this was coming; no one wanted to be the one to call the shot. We were many months behind on data collecting, the motivation throughout the entire team was stagnant, no one wanted to curate the "Mood Board", etc. What should have felt like a kick to the gut, or a sense of panic was met with immediate relief. It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.</p>\n<p>If you haven\'t noticed, this is only part 1 of X in a series of posts I hope to write. Documenting the struggles we faced, and the lessons we learned throughout the process of creating the VanCity Drinks app.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X45YY97FmL4">(Worse is Better. Really. It is.)</a></strong> When I say this, it comes from the experience of having an MVP, than deciding not to take it to market, and instead spending the time and resources re-architecting the entire project. There will be a point in time to re-architect your application, and the MVP stage is not that time. Neither is the first 100 users. Not the next 500 users. Time spent re-architecting can be better utilized somewhere else. Once development hindered to the point where one spends more time bolting on hacks instead of focusing on features, is the time to consider re-architecting.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have to explain UI. It\'s bad UI.</strong><br/>\n<em><del><a href="https://i.imgur.com/GoxUIlT.jpg">just like that one meme. haha, so clever austin..</a></del></em><br/>\nOne part that irritated me about the app, was a single part of the UX flow. This single part of app killed the initial presence the app brought, and every single user was met with confusion upon entering the <strong>SECOND SCREEN</strong>. That damn map. It took weeks of serious prototyping to create something that felt more natural. The end result of what had been created unfortunately will not see the light of day(?), however it really challenged me to think outside the box when developing a user-flow.</p>\n<p>One of the best UI decisions we ever <em>stole</em> was the "Mood Board". I vaguely remember the conception of the idea, but <sup><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/westhelawyer/">@westhelawyer</a></strong></sup>mentioned something about how Spotify has music playlists in tiles, based on common moods people may be feeling. Thus the "Mood Board" was born. Everyone at that table realized immediately how huge this feature could be. I remember being ecstatic to get home and start prototyping. The idea was genius. This was the point we realized, VanCity Drinks App was essentially <em>the playlist for drinking</em>. Curated by the people that know drinking in Vancouver best.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        <img src="/post-mortem-01.jpg" alt="The Mood Board" title="Mood Board" />\n        <span>‚ù§Ô∏è</span>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <img src="/post-mortem-02.jpg" alt="The map screen/second screen" title="The Map" />\n        <span>üñïüèª</span>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<br/>\n<p><a href="https://www.tmwed.io/vancity-drinks-post-mortem-ii/">Part II</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"VanCity Drinks:Post Mortem I",date:"25 October, 2017",cover:"/post-mortem-00.jpg",description:"The first in a series about my experience bootstrapping VanCity Drinks, and the problems I faced along the way."}},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"tmwed",siteUrl:"https://tmwed.io",siteTitleAlt:"tmwed ‚Äì tomorrow is wednesday."},pathPrefix:""}},pathContext:{slug:"/vancity-drinks-post-mortem-i/"}}}});
